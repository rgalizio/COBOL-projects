# COBOL-projects

This is a folder with my random COBOL projects.

Don't expect greatness right now.  

<b>"helloworld"</b> - the traditional first program. It gets to live here since it was the first (technically the second in my life) program I ever got to work.

<b>"Fibonacci"</b> - A basic work to calculate entries in the Fibonacci sequence.  It is here since it was the first unguided program I made.  It needs work, but it actually functions on its own.
